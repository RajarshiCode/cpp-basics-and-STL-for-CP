    /*
        STL is basically Standard Template Library, 
        Suppose we want to make a container(a data structure for instance), for that are you going to write long long codes? NO.
        So in stl we have predifined templates, containers, algorithms.

        STL consists of 4 things:-
        1.Containers.
        2.Iterators.
        3.Algorithms.
        4.Functions.

        STL stands for standard template library which contains a lot of pre-defined templates in terms of containers and classes which makes it very easy for developers or programmers to implement different data structures easily without having to write complete code and worry about space-time complexities.
    
        Containers are of 4 types:-
        
        1. Sequential
            1. vector
            2. list
            3. dequeue
            4. array
            5. forward_list


        2. Adapter
            1. queue
            2. priority_queue
            3. stack


        3. Associative
            1. set
            2. multiset
            3. map
            4. multimap


        4. Unordered Associative
            1. unordered set
            2. unordered map
            3. unordered multimap
            4. unordered multiset
