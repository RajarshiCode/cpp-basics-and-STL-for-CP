        STL is basically Standard Template Library, 
        Suppose we want to make a container(a data structure for instance), for that are you going to write long long codes? NO.
        So in stl we have predifined templates, containers, algorithms.

        STL consists of 4 things:-
        1.Containers.
        2.Iterators.
        3.Algorithms.
        4.Functions.

        STL stands for standard template library which contains a lot of pre-defined templates in terms of containers and classes which makes it very easy for developers or programmers to implement different data structures easily without having to write complete code and worry about space-time complexities.
    
        Containers are of 4 types:-
        
        1. Sequential
            1. vector : - Dynamic contiguous array (class template)
            2. list : - Doubly-linked list (class template)
            3. deque : - Double-ended queue (class template)
            4. array : - Static contiguous array (class template)
            5. forward_list : - Singly-linked list (class template)


        2. Adapter
            1. queue : - Adapts a container to provide queue (FIFO data structure) (class template).
            2. priority_queue : - Adapts a container to provide priority queue (class template). 
            3. stack : - Adapts a container to provide stack (LIFO data structure) (class template).


        3. Associative
            1. set : - Collection of unique keys, sorted by keys (class template)                        
            2. multiset : - Collection of keys, sorted by keys (class template)
            3. map : - Collection of key-value pairs, sorted by keys, keys are unique (class template).
            4. multimap : - Collection of key-value pairs, sorted by keys 


        4. Unordered Associative
            1. unordered set : - Collection of unique keys, hashed by keys. (class template)
            2. unordered map : - Collection of key-value pairs, hashed by keys, keys are unique. (class template)
            3. unordered multimap : - Collection of key-value pairs, hashed by keys (class template)
            4. unordered multiset : - Collection of keys, hashed by keys (class template)
